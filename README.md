# Booklist
This is a list of books that I have read relating to technology, business and entertainment.

I started this journey on November 18, 2018 on the reccomendation of my friend Christopher Waggoner.  He asked me what I was reading and I didn't have an answer for him.  I didn't feel like I had the time to read until I realized that I had two hours of commute time each day so I started listening to audio books from Audible.  Since that point I have read/listened to twenty-four books in fifteen months and the list continues to grow.  I will continue to add additional titles that I feel are good reads as time goes on.

Thanks,
